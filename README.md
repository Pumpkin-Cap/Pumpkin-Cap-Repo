```

## Why?

* We were all interested in designing a 'game'.
* We acknowledged that learning how to code offers very little gratification in the early stages.
* We wanted to explore outside of what technologies we were most comfortable with, i.e., the implementation of WebSockets, Animejs, and Monaco-Editor. 


## Key Features

* User gets an introduction to the basics of coding through an interactive exchange with General Joe.
* User begins implementing their understanding of control flow through the Monaco-Editor within the browser so their code can be tested.
* User cannot skip levels to ensure accumulative comprehension.
* User has the option of 'inviting' someone else to a room to help them solve the level.
* User can change their username or password.
* User progress get's tracked as they advance.
